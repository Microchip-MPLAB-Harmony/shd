description: >
  PIR Click is a pyroelectric sensor that generates a voltage 
  when exposed to infrared radiation emitted by live bodies. 
  It is equipped with the PL-N823-01, an infrared sensor from
  KEMET that uses the pyroelectric effect of ceramic by 
  absorbing infrared rays emitted from the human body
